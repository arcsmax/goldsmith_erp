SUMMARY
================================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: GOOD ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION, POOR OPERATIONAL DOCUMENTATION

What's Well Documented:
- Architecture and design decisions
- Installation and setup
- Feature specifications
- Business requirements

What's Missing:
- Production deployment
- Database schema
- API client examples
- User manual
- Contributing guidelines
- Security hardening
- Testing strategy
- Troubleshooting guides

CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION:
1. Production deployment guide
2. Security hardening checklist
3. Database schema documentation
4. User manual for non-technical users

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Review dates on all docs - are they still accurate?
2. Check if P0 issues from ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW have been fixed
3. Create the 4 critical docs above
4. Consider documentation generation (MkDocs)
5. Add documentation link in README pointing to all docs
